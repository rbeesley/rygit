*Ry’s Git Tutorial* is a complete introduction to distributed version control 
with a focus on practical command line usage. 
We explain [Git](http://git-scm.com/)’s robust branching, merging, and collaboration capabilities 
from the ground up, so prior experience with centralized systems like SVN or CVS is not required.
